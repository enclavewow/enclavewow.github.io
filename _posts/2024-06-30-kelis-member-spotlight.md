Meet **Kelis** (she/her)! Kelis formally joined the guild late 2023. However, for our members that have been here for a while, Kelis is a name you might've seen around our guild long before that. Kelis is a long-time friend of the guild prior, often joining us for fun raids. Since formally joining, she's been a lovely part of our community.

> Hi I'm Kelis, known IRL as Stacy.  I live in Missouri with my partner Krystal and our upstairs neighbor Dustin (who I've actually had longer than Krystal).  I just celebrated my 42nd birthday last month (the meaning of life the universe and everything), and I've lived here since I came for college about 25 years ago. 

What do you do for work irl?
: I work for the university here, and have for the last 21 years. It's nice because I frequently have down time where I can play games or read.   

What's a fun fact about you or a quote that you really enjoy?
: I can fix just about anything.  I'm the person all my friends call when they need a broken thing fixed (or a swimming pool installed).   I also catch all frogs, lizards, snakes and turtles. My degree is in fisheries and wildlife and my favorite was always Herps.  If I'm driving and there is a turtle in need of rescue, you can bet I'm braking. 

If you could have dinner with any fictional character, who would it be and why? 
: I'd have a hard time choosing between Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg from Discworld.  I just think they'd be a riot to sit around and chat with, plus getting all the Granny advice.  

If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and what would you do there? 
: I'd go to Costa Rica.  I'd love to visit the cloud forest, look at all the frogs, and see sloths!  Plus, sea turtle nesting grounds, bioluminescent oceans, and jungles.  

If you could switch lives with any animal for a day, which would you choose and why? 
: I think I'd pick a whale.  I'm not very good at water in my natural form (knee injury from rugby) so it would be nice to be able to dive down and enjoy the ocean.  Plus, I could do all the fancy whale singing.

What's one cause or issue you are passionate about? 
: I really wish we had universal healthcare here.  I can't figure out how we missed the boat on that one (I mean, logically, i know, but stupid).  I don't think that anyone should lose their house/car/job because of medical bills, or even worse just not get the care they need because they can't afford it.  We deserve better.  

What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?  
: Life ain't fair - my dad.
