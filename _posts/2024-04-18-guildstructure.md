### BiS Lists for Cata Prepatch (ICC/RS 25)

We will require RSM raiders to submit a new BiS list for the pre-patch. For warriors, paladins, shamans, druids, death knights, and hunters, please note that there is some penalty for wearing a different type of armour. Take note of that as you make your BiS lists. 

You should be doing this through **[eightyupgrades](https://eightyupgrades.com/)**. AFter you have made your BiS list, please send the link of it to Kim. 


### Phase Decay

> An 80% decay will be applied when we hit pre-patch. 
{: .prompt-warning }

For those that are unaware of this, we do a big decay between phases. 

**What does this do?**
We basically crunch all the numbers; we increase the elasticity of your PR. You retain your priority. However, each piece of gear you acquire or any EP you get will matter more. 

For example, before the decay:
>  You have 12000 EP and 5000 GP. Your PR is 2.4. 

After the decay:
> You have 2400 EP and 1000 GP. Your PR remains 2.4

However, the amount of EP you get and GP for each piece of gear does not change; each piece of gear and EP you get/earn will matter more after the phase decay. 

For example, before the decay, getting a piece of gear worth 1000 GP:
> You have 12000 EP and 5000 + 1000 GP. Your PR becomes 2. 

After the decay:
> You have 2400 EP and 1000 + 1000 GP. Your PR becomes 1.2.
