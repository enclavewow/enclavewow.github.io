### Officers

Officers in **Enclave** are integral members who volunteer their time to keep the guild running smoothly, thereby ensuring everyone can enjoy the game and progress through content. They manage day-to-day operations, organise events, and support guild members, all without receiving any extra in-game perks. Officers are approachable and actively participate in guild discussions and decision-making processes. You may often seen in the "Round Table" channel on Discord during weekly meetings. Their commitment is to the guild's collective success and enjoyment.
