What do you do for work irl?
:  I work for a high-end furniture warehouse. It most certainly is not the most glamorous job in the world but it most certainly is the easiest.

What's a fun fact about you or a quote that you really enjoy?
: A fun fact about me that not everyone knows apparently is I have four children. And that I did not forget how they were made lol

What's the most unusual food you love to eat?
: I would say the least normal thing that I love to eat is a grilled ham& cheese with ketchup as the dipping sauce. Back story of why was I saw it done on the move Bruce Almighty and I was like Imma try that, and its been that way ever since.

Whatâ€™s a hidden talent or party trick you can do?
: Pretty simple talent i guess but I have met very few people that have been able to do it actually. I can fold my tongue back and have it stick like a suction cup for really as long as I want to.

If you could instantly become an expert in one non-gaming hobby, what would it be? 
: Surfing, I used to live along the coast and went like once to try and surf. Even though I did not ever successfully ride a wave, I still had a lot of fun and would love to go more often.

What's your go-to comfort food? Why is it  your comfort food?
: Simple answer: Nachos. And really not all that picky when it come to them either. I can deal with them like ballpark style with the plastic cheese or the grate my own cheese and melt it on the oven kind.

Which movie or TV show character do you relate to the most, and why?
: Once again not to much deliberation on the answer. My wife on a constant reminds of how much I am like Squidward from Spongebob. Which, as life has gone on I can't say I disagree.
