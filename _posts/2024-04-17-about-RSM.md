## About Our Team

**Ready Set Minions** (abbrev. RSM) is a *[semi-casual](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raidtype/#semi-casual)* 25-player progression raid team in the guild. It runs on Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30-10:00 ST (server time) weekly. Our achievements include:

## Raider Expectations 

RSM raiders are expected to abide by our [raider expectations](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raider-expectations/). In addition, they are expected to:
- Perform at or above the average performance expected of their class, spec, and gear. 
- Practice good raiding habits (e.g., reduce downtime by grouping, flasking, and eating after a raid, being a team player, etc.)
- Come to raid prepared (e.g., reading spreadsheets, knowing their roles, knowing the fights)
- Attend *both* raid nights (attendance is important)
- Have properly enchanted and gemmed gear (the guild subsidises this heavily)
- Continuously look for ways to improve their performance
- Have an open mind to provide *and* receive constructive feedback to and from, respectively, their fellow raiders

## Loot System
We use the [EPGP loot system](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/epgp/) in RSM. All information is available, fully for transparency, to rostered raiders. 

## Rotating Bench

To ensure that we can continue to use EPGP across our 25-player raids, the roster is maintained at around 28-30 raiders. This means that all raiders, except the raid lead, will be scheduled to be 'benched' once approximately every 6-9 weeks. During this week, benched raiders will accumulate full EP (except wipe bonuses).

Benched weeks do not count towards the attendance policy. However, raiders will not earn EP during the weeks that raiders are absent beyond the scheduled week off.

The rotating bench policy places fairness above raid composition when deciding who to bench.
