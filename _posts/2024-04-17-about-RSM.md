**Ready Set Minions** (abbrev. RSM) is a *[semi-casual](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raidtype/#semi-casual)* 25-player progression raid team in the guild. It runs on Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30-10:00 ST (server time) weekly. Our achievements include:

| Raid               | Progression Status         |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Naxxramas     | 15/15   |
| Ulduar       | 14/14 (HM)  |
| Trial of the Grand Crusader      | 5/5 (heroic)   |
| Icecrown Citadel     | 11/12 (heroic), 12/12 (normal)   |
| Ruby Sanctum      | 1/1 (normal)   |

RSM raiders are expected to abide by our [raider expectations](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raider-expectations/). In addition, they are expected to:
- Perform at or above the average performance expected of their class, spec, and gear. 
- Practice good raiding habits (e.g., reduce downtime by grouping, flasking, and eating after a raid, being a team player, etc.)
- Come to raid prepared (e.g., reading spreadsheets, knowing their roles, knowing the fights)
- Attend *both* raid nights (attendance is important)
- Have properly enchanted and gemmed gear (the guild subsidises this heavily)
- Continuously look for ways to improve their performance
- Have an open mind to provide *and* receive constructive feedback to and from, respectively, their fellow raiders
