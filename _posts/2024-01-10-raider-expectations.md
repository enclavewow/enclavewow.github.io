As part of our commitment to providing a successful and enjoyable raiding experience for all members, we have set the following expectations for all raiders:

### Attendance
Raiders need to maintain a minimum attendance rate of 65%. Consistent participation is crucial for our collective success in raids.

### Communication
- Advance Notice for Absences: If you know you'll be absent, inform us as early as possible. This allows us to adjust our strategy and call upon substitutes if necessary.
- Late Arrivals: Similarly, if you expect to be late, please notify us in advance. Prompt communication helps us manage the raid more effectively.
- Commitment: If you commit to raiding on a specific day, you are expected to be available for the entirety of the raid, including subsequent days if the raid spans multiple sessions. Consistency is key to our progress.

### Respect 
Treat all guild members with respect. Share your frustrations, concerns, and questions in a constructive and respectful manner. Our community thrives on mutual respect and support.

*All these expectations are an expected courtesy to our officers who volunteer significant time to organise and manage raids.* Extend common courtesy to them by keeping them informed. Do not leave your fellow raiders and officers wondering about your status - communication is essential.

We understand that emergencies and unexpected situations occur. If you are unable to meet the above expectations due to unforeseen circumstances, please check in with us afterwards at your earliest convenience.

### Required Addons

> Required addons are only applicable to raiders in the [Ready Set Minions raid team](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raiding-with-enclave/#ready-set-minions-rsm).
{: .prompt-warning }

- Core Loot Manager
- Weakauras
	- Fojji's T10 Pack and all its dependencies
	- Fojji's RS Pack
 
 DBM and/or BigWigs is not required. We recommend you disable them for ICC/RS bosses as it will conflict with Fojji's WA packs. 
 
 ## What happens when expectations are not met?
 The guiding principle of this guild has always been to treat each other with kindness, empathy, compassion, and effective communication. We expect that you communicate any updates to us in reasonable time. It is a team game and twenty-four others count on your presence. Know that we also understand that *life happens* - perhaps you had a rough day, something significant happened in your life, or any of the thousand other valid reasons. 
 
 Not showing up to raid isn't necessarily the worst thing (unless it becomes a reoccuring issue). What is worse is that you don't show up, don't communicate it, and treat it as if nothing happened. 
 
 Upon an unexpected event where raiders are late/absent, we will make efforts to contact raiders during raid and again (if we get no response) in a day or so. 
 - Should we get no response by **Monday** of the following week, we will treat it as if you will not make it to raid that following week. No action beyond this will be taken as life happens. 
 - Should we get no response nor action to communicate to us in **two weeks**, we will remove your spot from the roster. 
 
Like all policies, this is a guideline; every person's situation is different and our officers are more than willing to help and listen. Some examples of exceptions include:
- We may choose to hold roster spots for an extended period of time in extenuating circumstances.
- We may apply more guild disciplinary actions if a raider continues to be disrespectful.
