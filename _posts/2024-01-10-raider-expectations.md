As part of our commitment to providing a successful and enjoyable raiding experience for all members, we have set the following expectations for all raiders:

### Attendance
Raiders need to maintain a minimum attendance rate of 65%. Consistent participation is crucial for our collective success in raids.

### Communication
- Advance Notice for Absences: If you know you'll be absent, inform us as early as possible. This allows us to adjust our strategy and call upon substitutes if necessary.
- Late Arrivals: Similarly, if you expect to be late, please notify us in advance. Prompt communication helps us manage the raid more effectively.
- Commitment: If you commit to raiding on a specific day, you are expected to be available for the entirety of the raid, including subsequent days if the raid spans multiple sessions. Consistency is key to our progress.

### Respect 
Treat all guild members with respect. Share your frustrations, concerns, and questions in a constructive and respectful manner. Our community thrives on mutual respect and support.

All these expectations are an expected courtesy to our officers who volunteer significant time to organise and manage raids, ensuring that we can all enjoy our gaming experience. Extend common courtesy to them by keeping them informed. Do not leave your fellow raiders and officers wondering about your status - communication is essential.

We understand that emergencies and unexpected situations occur. If you are unable to meet the above expectations due to unforeseen circumstances, please check in with us afterwards at your earliest convenience.

### Required Addons

- Core Loot Manager
- Weakauras
 - Fojji's T10 Pack and all its dependencies
 - Fojji's RS Pack
 
 DBM and/or BigWigs is not required. We recommend you disable them for ICC/RS bosses as it will conflict with Fojji's WA packs.
