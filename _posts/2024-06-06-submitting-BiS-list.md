### BiS Lists

As part of our [EPGP loot system](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/epgp-cata/) in Ready Set Minions (Cataclysm), we require all rostered raiders to submit their BiS list. In order to click the **BiS** button in CLM, you must have submitted a BiS list to **Kindroth**, the loot master. You can only hit the **BiS** button if the item matches the item on your BiS list. 

Hitting BiS will automatically prioritise your bid above every other type of bid. You will only be competing with others that hit the BiS button. 

### Submitting Your List 

We require that you use **[Sixty Upgrades (Cataclysm)](https://sixtyupgrades.com/cata/)** to submit your list to Kindroth. 

Step 1
: Register or sign in on the website

_Step 2: Creating your character_

> When you create your character, a prompt may pop up saying they've found a live character. It **does not matter** what you choose; choose whichever.

Step 3
: After your character is loaded (or is a fresh character). Click on each slot, regardless if there's an item there or not, and put in the item **of your choice**. This should be the BiS item. Do not worry about enchants or gems. 

Step 4
: Export the character by clicking the **share** button. Copy the link and send it to Kindroth.
