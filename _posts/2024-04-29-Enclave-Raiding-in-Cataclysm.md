**Ready Set Minions**, the guild's 25-player progression team, will be continuing into Cataclysm with major changes. Upon Cataclysm's launch on May 20th, 2024, the raid team will fully embrace the **semi-hardcore** tag and all its expectations and goals. Under our revised description of different [types of raiding](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raidtype), RSM was **semi-casual** in Wrath. As such, raiders continuing into Cataclysm with the intent to raid in RSM should expect a realistic increase in expectations and goals. 

> Did you know? In Cataclysm, raid locks for 10-player and 25-player encounters are **shared**, with the same loot tables for all the bosses.

## Detailed Description of Changes

### Rationale

WotLK has taught many lessons in raiding and guild leading. Lessons that we will put to pen and paper as we enter a new expansion.

The above quote is not to imply that RSM was a failure. On the contrary, from the first iteration of the guild’s 25-player raid team to how it is at the end of Wrath, it was a monumental change. However, it is a a reminder that on the things we know we could’ve done better, now is the chance to do them better. 

**Lesson 1**: Differing expectations amongst raiders leading to frustrations amongst players (e.g., performance)
- Solution: Explicitly state the roster’s solutions for performance, attendance, and overall raider expectations (e.g., respect, communication). 

**Lesson 2**: Leadership was overly hesitant, reluctant, and/or late in addressing concerns (e.g., raid performance)
- Solution: Add action plans, in writing, to address when said expectations are not met. Maintain a diligent pursuit to following through. Furthermore, set deadlines for when action is to be taken, and abide by them. For instance, if the deadline for not meeting expectations and the turnaround to meet them again is three weeks, follow through. 

**Lesson 3**: Inadequate support system for struggling raiders
- Solution: Ensure the support nets are there to help raiders succeed. Follow through when raiders ignore said support net and continue to not meet said expectations. This can come in the form of log reviews (semi-regularly), check-ins with team members, one-on-ones, and directing them them towards support forums/guides/discords. 

**Lesson 4**: Unclear location/place to provide feedback from the roster to the leaders
- 	Solution: Part of the RSM raid requirements will be a log review night. Part of that session will be 	to go over anonymous feedback submitted by raiders. 

### RSM-specific expectations

Raiders are expected to follow guild-wide raiding expectations. In addition to general raid-wide raid expectations, RSM raiders are expected to:
- Have an average to above knowledge of their class and spec. For instance, we should expect you to know what your stat priorities are for your class/spec.
- Be amendable to constructive criticism. We’re not out to get you – trust us. We want to help you, invest time into each other, and help the team get better. If we reach out, know that we’re not trying to get rid of you. 
- Enchant and gem their gear properly. Showing up to raid multiple weeks, after being notified that your gear has problems, is unacceptable. Especially when the guild helps with this. 
- Spend time outside of raid to engage with strategies, mastery of your class/spec, and raid-specific strategies for bosses. 

### Attendance
Raiders are expected to keep a 75% attendance rate over eight weeks. This means that you should endeavour to be there, barring extenuating circumstances, for six out of eight weeks. 

### Loot

> The following may change and is dependent upon roster stabilisation.
{: .prompt-info }

For the first 3 weeks, we anticipate loot will be SRs. After that, assuming the roster has stabilised, loot will be done through EPGP. If you do not know what EPGP is, please head over [here](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/epgp/) to find out. Do note that we may tweak the EPGP system previously used in Wrath for Cataclysm. 

### Rotating Bench

To ensure that we can continue to use EPGP across our 25-player raids, the roster is maintained at around 28-30 raiders. This means that all raiders, except the raid lead, will be scheduled to be ‘benched’ once approximately every 6-9 weeks. During this week, benched raiders will accumulate full EP (except wipe bonuses).

Benched weeks do not count towards the attendance policy. However, raiders will not earn EP during the weeks that raiders are absent beyond the scheduled week off.

The rotating bench policy places fairness above raid composition when deciding who to bench.

### Log Review
On the last Thursday of each month, the raid will do a log review, as well as to check in with each other about the progress of raid. If you are scheduled as bench that week, you do not have to be there. Raid members are highly encouraged to attend; for those that cannot attend, we will endeavour to record the session. Raiders are expected to know the general discussion points so that they are prepared for the upcoming raids. 

### DPS Performance
To enhance our raid performance, it’s important to grasp a key concept we’re introducing: **standard deviation**. This is a statistical term that indicates how spread out or clustered our DPS (damage per second) values are around the average DPS of the raid.

A small standard deviation (abbrev. STV) means most DPS values are close to the average, showing consistency among players. A large standard deviation indicates a broader range of DPS values, suggesting greater variability in performance. 

Our goal is to ensure that all DPS players achieve a DPS **within one standard deviation of the raid's average DPS or higher**. This means we encourage you to meet or exceed the average, but not fall below it by too much. This approach ensures no player is significantly lagging, while still rewarding those who perform above average.

Implementing this policy will help us operate more cohesively as a unit, thus boosting our effectiveness and success in raids.

![STV Example](/images/stvdevexample.png)
_Example 1: A spread of DPS values of an example raid. The error bars represent this raid's **one standard deviation**. The raid's goal is to have all the DPS players be within that bar or higher._

In the above example, players 13 to 16 will be given a gentle nudge that they’re performing on the lower end. No formal action will be taken here – it’s to a) bring it to their attention, and b) see if they need any help. 

Players 17, 18, 19, and 20 are not meeting requirements. We will be paying closer attention and reviewing their logs more intensely. 

#### Important Note About STV
At its core, using STV is a tool to help the roster reach its performance goals. Each case will be reviewed individually. Those padding DPS numbers at the expense of mechanics (e.g., staying on a boss when the RL tells you to go somewhere else) are equally failing to meet raid expectations. 

### Healer Performance

Healer performance is much, much tricker to quantify. Parses and quantification from logs are inaccurate as they are dependent on the raid’s damage taken. As such, healer performance will be reviewed through general log reviews. When we find that an obstacle is a result of a healer(s), we will reach out in kind to address it. 

Subsequent weeks in making the same mistakes, however, will result in the same actions taken. In other words, healer performance will be reviewed holistically. 

### Tank Performance

When a fight results in tanks dying because they are not playing their role correctly, we will reach out to address it. If efforts are not made to correct those mistakes and they keep dying, actions will be taken to bench that player. As such, the raid will also continue its practice in diverting tank loot to a designated third tank. During less progression-heavy fights, the third tank is expected to tank occasionally and rotate with the other two tanks.  

Some examples of situations where the tank is not performing well:
- Improper use of cooldowns (and continuous improper use after it was brought to their attention)
- Improper gemming/gearing/enchanting for the roster’s needs
- ‘Selfish’ tanking – during progression especially, when the tank decides to parse instead of building mitigation
- Wrong rotation leading to threat issues

### Unmet Expectations

|Week              | Action       |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- |
|1st week          |Notice from the raid/role lead that their damage is below the expectation (no action)|
|2nd week          |Check-in with the player + create a plan together with them to help |
|3rd week          |2 week notice|
|4th week          |1 week notice|
|5th week          |Move onto bench status (no exceptions – it’s been five weeks) |
