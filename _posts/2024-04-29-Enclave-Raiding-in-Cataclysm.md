## 25-Player Raiding (RSM)

**Ready Set Minions**, the guild's 25-player progression team, will be continuing into Cataclysm with major changes. Upon Cataclysm's launch on May 20th, 2024, the raid team will fully embrace the **semi-hardcore** tag and all its expectations and goals. Under our revised description of different [types of raiding](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raidtype), RSM was **semi-casual** in Wrath. As such, raiders continuing into Cataclysm with the intent to raid in RSM should expect a realistic increase in expectations and goals.

### RSM expectations
We expect raiders to follow the [general, guild-wide expectations](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raider-expectations/) for all raiders. In particular, note the sections on attendance, communication, and respect. When these expectations are not met, it affects the team as well as the leaders that dedicate significant amounts of time organising raids. 

Furthermore, RSM will have some specific expectations and policies. As that is finalised, we will publish it on the website and notify raiders on Discord.
