## Class Discords
Class discords are an invaluable source of information. For raiders, this *is* the place to start with, regardless of skill level, for any tips to improve performance. The community guides' (e.g., Wowhead, Icyveins) authors are usually found in these class discords. Usually, they have a place for log reviews as well.
