Hey friends!

I'm thrilled to announce the latest shiny addition to our guild's website â€“ the **[Member Spotlight](https://enclavewow.github.io/member-spotlight/)** page! ðŸŒŸðŸŽ‰

Every few weeks, we'll turn the spotlight on one of our very own, diving into the quirks and perks that make them unique. Think of it as a fun way to learn who's casting spells next to you (and whoâ€™s sneaking your loot! ðŸ˜‰). It's all about building connections beyond the raids and dungeons.

Keep your eyes peeled! You never know, you might discover that your raid buddy is also a secret movie buff, shares your passion for exotic pets, or has traveled to places youâ€™ve only dreamed of visiting. Letâ€™s get ready to connect, laugh, and celebrate our community. Because behind every character is a story worth sharing â€“ and who knows? You might find more in common than just your shared love for the game!

-Kerry ðŸŒŸ
