As part of our commitment to providing a successful and enjoyable raiding experience for all members, we have set the following expectations for all raiders:

### Guild Rank Changes

| Current               | Proposed         |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Guild Master      | Guild Master   |
| Officer       | Officer  |
| Raid/Role Lead      | Team Lead   |
| Veteran Raiders       | Guardian   |
| Veterans      | Veteran   |
| Raiders     | Member   |
| Member | Initiate   |

With the introduction of guild advancement and guild achievements, rank-and-file ranks (veteran, member, initiate) will be primarily based on activity level. 

1. Veteran
Members who have been active in the guild for at least 2 months and maintain regular activity (once every 5-7 days). Demotion to Member status occurs after 14 days of inactivity.
2. Member
Active members who engage with the guild at least once every 14 days. New Members automatically advance from Initiate after meeting initial activity requirements.
3. Initiate
New members of the guild who will be promoted to Member after being active once in the last 7 days and spending at least 7 days in the guild.

### Guardian
