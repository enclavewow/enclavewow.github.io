With a new expansion comes an opportunity to restructure our guild to better suit the community. 

## Guild Rank Changes

| Current               | Proposed         |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Guild Master      | Guild Master   |
| Officer       | Officer  |
| Raid/Role Lead      | Team Lead   |
| Veteran Raiders       | Guardian   |
| Veterans      | Veteran   |
| Raiders     | Member   |
| Member | Initiate   |

With the introduction of guild advancement and guild achievements, rank-and-file ranks (veteran, member, initiate) will be primarily based on activity level. 

1. Veteran: members who have been active in the guild for at least 2 months and maintain regular activity (once every 5-7 days). Demotion to Member status occurs after 14 days of inactivity.
2. Member: active members who engage with the guild at least once every 14 days. New Members automatically advance from Initiate after meeting initial activity requirements.
3. Initiate: new members of the guild who will be promoted to Member after being active once in the last 7 days and spending at least 7 days in the guild.

All activity level changes will be tracked by an addon. Promotions/demotions will be largely automated as well. 

### Guardian

_Summary of the new Guardian rank in the guild_

Guardians are chosen by both officers and the community for their significant contributions to the social fabric of the guild. Guardians help maintain the wellbeing of members and lead by example.

## Raiding Changes
Unfortunately, the lack of information from Blizzard regarding raiding and loot makes it difficult to commit firmly to any changes. Until we receive information, the proposed restructuring of the guild will see multiple **team leads** leading either a 10-player or 25-player raid team. Opportunities to intersect, especially socially, between the teams will be provided every 2-3 weeks in the form of fun, socialising events. 

Currently, we are in the process of polling our guildies interested in Cataclysm about their preferred type of raiding.
