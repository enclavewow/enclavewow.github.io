_A Wild Clinic in his natural habitat..._

Known for his random facts and questions, Clinic keeps every conversation lively. A pioneer member of our guild, Clinic can level up a character from start to level cap in just two days.

What do you do for work out of the game?
: I was a dental assistant for a long time, come to think of it I started dental assisting right around the time Cataclysm first came out. Work changes compounded with the pandemic had me step away from that in 2020 and I've been doing social media for indie games since then with the occasional voiceover gig.

What's a fun fact about you or a quote that you really enjoy?
: Fun fact - I tend to enjoy animated media more than live-action, makes sense as a voiceover aficionado. Bonus fun fact: I don't actually collect couches

What's the most unusual food you love to eat?
: Just about anything Indian cuisine

If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and what would you do there?
: New Zealand or Switzerland for the 𝓢𝓒𝓔𝓝𝓔𝓡𝓨 

What's your most treasured possession and the story behind it?
: Idk if it's MOST treasured, but I have a derpy stuffed tiger that I won at a school carnival as a kid by winning bingo in 7 calls. He is the source of my good luck, and he doesn't really have a name. Ironically, I also didn't ever get the Zulian Tiger. Go figure.

What’s something you’re proud of that not many people know about?
: TBH joining this guild and gaining more of an open mind on LGBT stuff. Not that I was close-minded, I just didn't really give it all much thought.

If you could instantly become an expert in one non-gaming hobby, what would it be?
: Video editing
