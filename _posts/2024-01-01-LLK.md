## About Us
**Licking the Lich King** is a *[semi-hardcore](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raidtype/#semi-hardcore)* 10-player progression raid team in the guild. Currently, it runs on Sundays 9:15pm-midnight ST. Previously, we were formerly known as **Ulduar Slumber Party** and **Trial and Error**. 

### Progression Status (LLK)

### Coming Together
Established at the end of phase 1, ten adventurers (Anmorata, Bunny, Clinic, Kerry, Kindroth, Qyoot, Revi, Tara, Tontendez, Thunder) set out to tackle the challenges in Ulduar. Naming ourselves **Ulduar Slumber Party**, we tackled Ulduar 10 in its entirety! 

### Ulduar

Ulduar saw us tackle the raid with vigour. Throughout phase 2, we rose above challenge after challenge, until we finally reached Algalon in early 2023!

_USP downing Algalon for the first time!_
As we made progress on Algalon, we saw the departure of Tontendez and the joining of Mel in our team! We eventually managed to convince Algalon to pack its bags and leave our world alone! What a legendary battle it was!
