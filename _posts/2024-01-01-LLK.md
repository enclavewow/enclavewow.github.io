**Licking the Lich King** is a *[semi-hardcore](https://enclavewow.github.io/posts/raidtype/#semi-hardcore)* 10-player progression raid team in the guild. Currently, it runs on Sundays 9:15pm-midnight ST. Previously, we were formerly known as **Ulduar Slumber Party** and **Trial and Error**.

## Coming Together
Established at the end of phase 1, ten adventurers (Anmorata, Bunny, Clinic, Kerry, Kindroth, Qyoot, Revi, Tara, Tontendez, Thunder) set out to tackle the challenges in Ulduar. Naming ourselves **Ulduar Slumber Party**, we tackled Ulduar 10 in its entirety!

Ulduar saw us tackle the raid with vigour. Throughout phase 2, we rose above challenge after challenge, until we finally reached Algalon in early 2023! As we made progress on Algalon, we saw the departure of Tontendez and the joining of Mel in our team! We eventually managed to convince Algalon to pack its bags and leave our world alone! What a legendary battle it was!

In the time after, we saw the departure of Qyoot and Kerry from the team. Joining the team was Scuffed and Sav! Together, the team repeatedly showed Algalon and the rest of Ulduar who's boss! What a time it was - shared laughters, great times, and amazing fun!


## Trial of the Grand Crusader (ToGC)
As the team prepared for the next raid, the team went through some restructuring. We braneded ourselves as **Trial and Error**. We saw the departure of Tara and Scuffed, brief departure of Mel, and the rejoining of Qyoot and Kerry to the team. The team showed the Argent Tournament that those challenges were nothing more than a piece of cake! Anub? What a noob!

## Icecrown Citadel (ICC)

As is tradition, the team renamed themselves **Licking the Lich King** to prepare for their adventure in the icy north. At the start of ICC, our team consisted of Anmorata, Bunny, Clinic, Kerry, Kindroth, Mel, Qyoot, Revi, Sav, Thunder. Though the journey wasn't without its hiccups, we braved through (while draping ourselves in new armour), and arrived at the throne of the Lich King!
