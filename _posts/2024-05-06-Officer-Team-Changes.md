With Cataclysm Classic around the corner, the officer team will be undergoing some changes. We will bid a heartfelt farewell (on or shortly after May 20th) to two of our cherished officers, Kimberly and Thunder. In the meanwhile, please warmly welcome Anmorata into the fold.

Kimberly (Kim), our residential addon queen, will be stepping down when the WotLK experience ends. Kim has been a steadfast presence since phase one by anchoring our raids as one of our main tanks. Her dedication has seen us through countless great times, embodying both the spirit and the resilience of our community. As she shifts her focus to her raiding guild in Seasons of Discovery (SoD), we extend our deepest gratitude for her immense contributions and the incredible mark she's left on our guild.

Thunder, known for his wit and vibrant presence is also stepping back from his officer duties. As one of our most senior members, Thunder has been instrumental in crafting the unique culture of our guild. While his burgeoning commitments outside of WoW have led to this change, fret not, we are thrilled and reassured that he will continue to raid and engage with our community. Thunder, thank you for the laughs and leadership.

In light of these departures, I am happy to announce that Anmorata (Anmo) will be joining the officer team. Capable, charismatic, and approachable are just three of the many positive words to describe our newest officer. Since joining us in the early days of phase one, Anmo has proven himself as a dependable tank and a pillar of our community. As he takes the reins of our progression 25-player raid team, we're excited for the fresh energy and ideas he will bring to our leadership.

As our guild continues to grow and evolve, we anticipate further adjustments to our officer team to best meet the changing needs and dynamics of our community. This is an exciting time of evolution and growth for us all.

Please join me in expressing your appreciation for Kimberly and Thunder, and in extending a warm welcome to Anmorata. However, since Anmo is on vacation, please direct your questions about raiding to Kerry in the interim.
