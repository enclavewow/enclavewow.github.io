### What is it?

Effort Points/Gear Points (EPGP) is a loot system that quantifies the effort each member put towards common guild goals. Gear Points (GP) quantify what loot each member got back in return.

Loot priority (PR) is computed as the quotient of the two:
```  PR = EP/GP```

### Rationale

EPGP is based on a simple principle: the person with the higher PR gets the first say on loot (for an item they are interested in). As a result, the more effort you put in, the more gear you receive. EPGP spreads the wealth by ensuring that no one person can continuously get priority on a contested item.

### Effort Points

You earn effort points for participating in 25-player raids. How many EP you earn will depend on the raid and the activity within the raid.

| Effort                | Points         |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- |
| On-time at 7:20pm ST         | 1000 EP   |
| Every 15 min of raid        | 100 EP   |
| Progression wipes       | 100 EP   |
| Normal boss kills        | 200 EP   |
| End-of-wing boss kills      | 300 EP   |
| Lich King kills       | 500 EP   |
| HM kills: 2.0x EP | 400, 600, 1000  EP   |
| Raid completion     | 250 EP   |

### Gear Points

Gear points are the 'cost' of winning each item. You only receive GP for items you bid on and actually receive.
```0.483 * 2^(ilvl/26)+(rarity-4)) * (slot multipler)```

- 0.5: Neck, Back, Held In Off-hand, Shield, Ranged, Wands, Thrown, Quiver, Relic
- 0.75: Shoulder, Wrist, Feet
- 1: Head, Chest, Waist, Legs, One-Hand
- 1.5: Main Hand, Off Hand Weapon, Rings
- 2.0: Two-Hand, Trinkets

You can see GP values for items when hovering over them using CLM; these are listed as BiS GP, OS GP, Upgrade GP, respectively.
