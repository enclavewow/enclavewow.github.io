### What is it?

Effort Points/Gear Points (EPGP) is a loot system that quantifies the effort each member put towards common guild goals. Gear Points (GP) quantify what loot each member got back in return.

Loot priority (PR) is computed as the quotient of the two:
$$
\begin{equation}
  \PR = EP/GP
\end{equation}
$$
