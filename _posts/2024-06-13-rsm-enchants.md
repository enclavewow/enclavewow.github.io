### BiS Enchants (Maelstrom Crystals)

Best-in-slot enchants require [Malestrom Crystals](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/item=52722/maelstrom-crystal), which are only available by disenchanting ilvl 352 (unavailable right now), 359, or 372 gear. During progression, the likelihood of that happening is low as raiders are encouraged to gear themselves. As such, malestrom crystals are selling for high prices on the auction house. 

For RSM raiders, malestrom crystal enchants are subsidised for only **ilvl 372 BiS weapons**. Other enchants will not be considered at this time. You may opt to enchant your own gear with your own funds. 

#### Requiring An Enchant

If you meet the requirement above (ilvl 372 BiS weapon), you must contact either Anmorata or Kerry for approval. We'll allocate the crystals to the designated guild enchanter for the enchant. You may not contact any other officer for this - they'll simply refer you to us (Anmo/Kerry). 

### Transmog gear

Clicking the OS button in raid means that gear is used for your off-spec. When you take a piece of gear for OS, know that you may be called to fill a spot in a raid or dungeon group down the road. Loot history from RSM are pubicly available to all RSM raiders. 

For classes that can fill more than two roles (e.g., paladins, druids), you should only be rolling OS gear for one of the two remaining roles. If you are a retribution paladin, for instance, __do not take tank **and** healing gear__ as your OS. Choose one. If we find that you've done so, we will charge MS gear points on your OS gear. 

More importantly, raiders should not be clicking OS for transmog reasons. If you want an **uncontested** piece of gear for transmog reasons, Anmorata and Kerry will be expecting you to give us **TWO (2)** Malestrom Crystals before next week's raid. You can decide whether the look is worth the price. Gold will not be accepted - it must be the crystals. 

### Why is the raid so strict on malestrom crystals?

Because they're expensive and everyone wants them. We need to allocate them efficiently and ensure our limited supply of them is best used for this purpose.
