### Meet Your Officers

![Kerry](/images/kerry.png){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Kerry** (they/them), our esteemed Guild Master, combines a passion for filet-o-fishes and all things Minions with a sharp wit fueled by goofy, punny jokes. As one of the longest-standing members of the guild, Kerry advocates fervently for an inclusive gaming community, one where gamers can find solace that their unique, wonderful self is celebrated.

![Clinic](/images/clinic.png){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Clinic** (he/him) is a talented voice actor whose dramatic flair enriches every guild raid. His encyclopedic knowledge of the game makes him the go-to person for any game-related questions. Known for his random facts and questions, Clinic keeps every conversation lively. A pioneer member of our guild, Clinic can level up a character from start to level cap in just two days.

![Baalyn](/images/baalyn.png){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Baalyn** (he/him), a professional chef and our guild's culinary consultant, can make anyone hungry with just a conversation. He's claimed a permanent spot in our Discord's AFK channel, where he’s virtually always available. Having joined us during phase 3, Baalyn has quickly become a steadfast member, adding both flavour and laughter to our guild life.

![Anmorata](/images/anmo.png){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Anmorata** (he/him), also known as Daddy Momo, plays a big, strong tank and is the newest officer of our guild. His skills at tanking are legendary — rumour has it he once took down the Lich King in a most unconventional setting: at a Burger King. With his funny, caring, and charismatic nature, Anmorata is set to lead our raid starting in Cataclysm and is a cherished member of our community.
