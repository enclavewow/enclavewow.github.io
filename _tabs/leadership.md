### Meet Your Officers

![Kerry](/images/kerry.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Kerry** (they/them), our esteemed Guild Master, combines a passion for filet-o-fishes and all things Minions with a sharp wit fueled by punny jokes. As one of the longest-standing members of the guild, Kerry’s leadership is deeply rooted in both experience and dedication. Known for a strong aversion to cheese and emphatic food opinions, Kerry advocates fervently for anti-capitalist principles, championing the redistribution of wealth both in-game and beyond.

![Thunder](/images/thunder.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Thunder** (he/him) is a funny, sarcastic, and mood-lifting choir teacher who teaches the nation's next generation in his real-life job. As our residential healing powerhouse, he loves gaming with his partner and friends, and is known for taking many detours when leveling, much to his guildies' amusement and frustration. Thunder is one of our guild's oldest members, having been with us since its earliest days.

&nbsp;

![Clinic](/images/clinic.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Clinic** (he/him) is a talented voice actor whose dramatic flair enriches every guild raid. His encyclopedic knowledge of the game makes him the go-to person for any game-related questions. Known for his random facts and questions, Clinic keeps every conversation lively. A pioneer member of our guild, Clinic can level up a character from start to level cap in just two days.

&nbsp;

![Kimberly](/images/kimberly.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Kimberly** (she/they), a founding member of our guild, sees herself as the guild’s mommy, a role she embraces wholeheartedly. She is fascinated with classic WoW, especially Seasons of Mastery, and is always ready to share her knowledge and nostalgia. Kimberly also delights the guild with her culinary creations, frequently posting pictures that tantalize the taste buds.

&nbsp;

![Baalyn](/images/baalyn.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Baalyn** (he/him), a professional chef and our guild's culinary consultant, can make anyone hungry with just a conversation. He's claimed a permanent spot in our Discord's AFK channel, where he’s virtually always available. Having joined us during phase 3, Baalyn has quickly become a steadfast member, adding both flavour and laughter to our guild life.

&nbsp;

![Anmorata](/images/anmo.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

**Anmorata** (he/him), also known as Daddy Momo, plays a big, strong tank and is the newest officer of our guild. His skills at tanking are legendary — rumour has it he once took down the Lich King in a most unconventional setting: at a Burger King. With his funny, caring, and charismatic nature, Anmorata is set to lead our raid starting in Cataclysm and is a cherished member of our community.
