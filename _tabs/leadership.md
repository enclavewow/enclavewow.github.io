Clinic is a talented voice actor whose dramatic flair enriches every guild raid. His encyclopedic knowledge of the game makes him the go-to person for any game-related questions. Known for his random facts and questions, Clinic keeps every conversation lively. A pioneer member of our guild, Clinic can level up a character from start to level cap in just two days.

![Kimberly](/images/kimberly.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

Kimberly, a founding member of our guild, sees herself as the guild’s mommy, a role she embraces wholeheartedly. She is fascinated with classic WoW, especially Season of Mastery, and is always ready to share her knowledge and nostalgia. Kimberly also delights the guild with her culinary creations, frequently posting pictures that tantalize the taste buds.

![Baalyn](/images/baalyn.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .left}

Baalyn, a professional chef and our guild's culinary consultant, can make anyone hungry with just a conversation. He's claimed a permanent spot in our Discord's AFK channel, where he’s virtually always available. Having joined us during phase 3, Baalyn has quickly become a steadfast member, adding both flavor and laughter to our guild life.

![Anmorata](/images/anmo.jpg){: width="120" height="120" .right}

Anmorata, also known as Daddy Momo, plays a big, strong tank and is the newest officer of our guild. His skills at tanking are legendary—rumor has it he once took down the Lich King in a most unconventional setting. With his funny, caring, and charismatic nature, Anmorata is set to lead our raids starting in the Cataclysm expansion and is a cherished member of our community.
