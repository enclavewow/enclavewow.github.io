## ABOUT US
Welcome to <Enclave>, foremerly known as <Sanctum> on Ashkandi-US and <Sanctuary> on Maladath-US. We're all about rainbow colours and a community that feels like a warm hug! As a social guild, we love to slay bosses, joke around, and make new friends, but we're even prouder to provide a safe space for our LGBTQIA+ members. We're all about love, laughter and loot here, and we have a great sense of humour to match. So, whether you're a seasoned player or just starting out, join us for some epic adventures and good times that are sure to leave you tickled pink!

Our weekends are packed with social activities that are so much fun, they're almost a crime. And if you're looking for some company during your grinding sessions, we've got plenty of members who love to hang out in our voice channels. So join us, and let's take on Azeroth together in a way that's just as fabulous as it is fierce!
