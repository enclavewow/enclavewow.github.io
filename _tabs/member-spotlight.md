What do you do for work out of the game?
: I work for a contracting company that supports the network capabilities of a federal government agency. I help with the set up and implementation of network equipment (routers, switches, etc.) to support whatever needs the sites require. I do travel to different sites occasionally, but I work from home and will Teams or Webex with boots on the ground. Working from home allows me to have some WoW time when the workload is light üòä.

What's a fun fact about you or a quote that you really enjoy?
: Why do it today when you can put it off to tomorrow.

What's your go-to karaoke song and why? 
: Pink Floyd ‚ÄúWish You Were Here‚Äù I had a good friend that I would sing karaoke with that passed away. So, I dedicate this song to him whenever I sing it.

What‚Äôs a hidden talent or party trick you can do? 
: I used to have a great party trick where I drank copious amounts of hard alcohol and then passed out in a compromising position, but my liver notified me that I should use moderation. Now I get high on life.

What‚Äôs the best piece of advice you‚Äôve ever received? 
: Opinions are like assholes. Everybody has one and they all stink! Words to live by.

What's your go-to comfort food? Why is it  your comfort food? 
: Macaroni and Cheese. Pasta and gooey cheese are the ultimate comfort food. The only problem is that I would want to eat a whole pan all by myself. I just remember eating this as a kid and it became my favorite ever since.

What hobby would you get into if time and money weren‚Äôt an issue? 
: I would become a pilot and fly around all over the world. There is lots of stuff that you can only see with an airplane.
