Meet **Prysen** (he/him)! He joined our little family in May 2023. 

What do you do for work out of the game?
: I now work for HEB, which is a Texas based grocery store, as a deli manager. 

What's a fun fact about you or a quote that you really enjoy?
: A fun fact about me is that I once played in the world series of poker. I didnt get very far but I play poker regularly and that was quite a fun experience. One quote that I really enjoy is from Ralph Waldo Emerson
"What you do speaks so loudly that I cannot hear what you say." I think it's a great reminder that our actions define us to others more so than our words.

What's your most treasured possession and the story behind it?
: My most treasured possession is an Autographed football from the 98 Denver Broncos championship team. My mom worked on an insurance fraud case involving one of the players and the Broncos was my dads favorite football team. So when they won the championship my mom asked the player if he could get a football  signed by the players and gifted to our dad for Christmas one year. When he passed away my family decided I should have it as football was something  he and I would watch and bond over more so than any of my other brothers.

If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and what would you do there?
: If I could travel anywhere in the world I would want to go to Australia to scuba dive on the great barrier reef. Also to see a kangaroo cause they're cool.

What's the most unusual food you love to eat?
: The most unusual food I enjoy is probably Alligator. Usually you find it on a stick and fried at like Ren Fair.

What hobby would you get into if time and money werenâ€™t an issue?
: The hobby I would want to get into is comic book collecting. I love reading comics and watching comic book movies. Whether its MCU or animated movies. So collecting the books that those stories are based on would be cool. And just owning a part of that history is fun.

If you could instantly become an expert in one non-gaming hobby, what would it be?
: If I could become an expert in a non gaming hobby it would be writing computer code.
